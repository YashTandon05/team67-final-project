                <p>
                  2024 was a year defined by hurricanes — and their
                  unpredictability. But what makes predicting a hurricane so
                  challenging? Start scrolling to explore.

                  From Mid August to Mid October alone, the Atlantic basin
                  experienced <strong>6 named hurricanes</strong>, from Tropical
                  Storms to Category 5s.

                  Climate data and models are essential tools for understanding
                  and predicting hurricanes. They provide insights into storm
                  behavior, intensity, and potential impacts, enabling better
                  preparedness and response strategies.

                <h2>What kind of infrastructure exists to keep people safe?</h2>
                <p>
                  Various infrastructures, such as early warning systems,
                  evacuation routes, and resilient buildings, are in place to
                  protect communities from hurricane impacts. These systems rely
                  on accurate data and forecasts to function effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We used real climate data from NOAA GOES16 to power this visualization! It is a low-orbiting satelite that provides continuous high-resolution data. This is just one example of the infrastructures in place to monitor and respond to hurricanes.
