                <h2>Early Season: January 2024</h2>
                <p>
                  The year began with typical winter patterns. In January,
                  precipitation was largely driven by frontal systems moving
                  across the continent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Atlantic basin remained quiet, as is expected during the
                  winter months.

                <p>
                  By late September, activity exploded. Hurricane Helene formed
                  and rapidly intensified, moving northward through the Gulf of
                  Mexico.

                  and moves inland, bringing torrential rains.

                  The storm's remnants continued to dump rain as they dissipated
                  over land.
