                <h2>What have we done so far?</h2>
                <p>
                  We have implemented an orthographic projection of the globe with interactive features to pan (by dragging with mouse) and zoom (by scrolling when hovered over the globe). Panning includes inertia tracking for user engagement and immersion.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Behind the scenes, we have parsed the RRQPE (Rainfall Rate Quantitative Precipitation Estimate) data from the GOES16 satellite for 2024 at 12 hour time intervals. We have used this to implement a projection of RRQPE values onto the globe in a heat map style tied to a slider and the users scroll wheel to traverse the values by time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since we have two interactions tied to the scroll wheel we have implemented tracking of the viewers’ mouse (to see which element they’re hovering over) to avoid conflicts.

                <h2>What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and why?</h2>
                <p>
                  The most challenging part of the project to design is the storytelling and scope. We have an immense data set to work with, but guiding the user through interesting, yet focused narratives about hurricanes will require careful planning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  We hope to avoid implementation of interactive elements that do not elucidate new data-driven conclusions. We are confident that the next week of compiling data will naturally lead us to interesting trends across hurricanes in the western hemisphere in 2024.

                <p>
                  By late September, activity exploded. Hurricane Helene formed and
                  rapidly intensified, moving northward through the Gulf of Mexico.

                  Watch the massive swirl of precipitation as it makes landfall and
                  moves inland, bringing torrential rains.
